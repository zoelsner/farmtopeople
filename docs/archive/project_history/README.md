## Key Documents by Purpose

### Planning Documents (Created This Week)
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_WEEK1.md`** - Created Monday Aug 25 as our "ship this week" plan
  - Accelerated timeline to ship by Friday
  - Connect scraperâ†’planner, add preferencesâ†’GPT
  - Not actually "Week 1" - we're in week 3!

- **`PDF_DESIGN_MILESTONE.md`** - Created tonight (Aug 25) 
  - Documents our evolution from emoji-heavy to Penny-style minimal
  - Identifies meal_plan_minimal.html as best design

### System Design (Weekend Planning)
- **`system_gap_analysis.md`** - Sunday Aug 24 analysis
  - Identified gaps: recipe details, cart integration, confirmation flow
  - Many of these gaps were addressed Monday!

- **`refactoring_opportunities.md`** - Sunday Aug 24 
  - Don Norman design principles analysis
  - Conversation state management design
  - Led to Monday's pragmatic approach

- **`ONBOARDING_SYSTEM.md`** - Saturday Aug 24
  - 6-step preference collection design
  - Already implemented and working

### Early Research (Week 1)
- **`architecture_analysis.md`** - Original architecture review
- **`farm_to_people_market_scan.md`** - Market opportunity analysis
- **`ftp_opus_analysis.md`** - Deep technical feasibility study

## Important Notes

1. **Timeline Confusion**: "IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_WEEK1" was created TODAY (Monday Aug 25) in Week 3, not Week 1. It's our accelerated plan to ship by end of THIS week.

2. **Rapid Progress**: Many "gaps" identified Sunday night were solved Monday:
   - âœ… Connected scraper to meal planner (Monday AM)
   - âœ… Added preferences to GPT prompts (Monday PM)
   - âœ… Created Penny-style PDF design (Monday night)

3. **Already Shipped**: Much of what's described as "planned" in these docs is already complete:
   - Onboarding system is live
   - Preference collection works
   - Scraper is comprehensive
   - SMS integration functional

## What's Actually Left (as of Monday night)

From the accelerated plan:
- Tuesday PM: Add help text to SMS
- Wednesday: Redis conversation state
- Thursday: Instant acknowledgments & modifications
- Friday: Production deployment

---

**Key Insight**: These documents show rapid iteration - what was a gap Sunday became a solution Monday. The project is much further along than early docs suggest.
