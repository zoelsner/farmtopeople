## üçΩÔ∏è **Suggested Meals Enhancement**

### **Current State:**
- Meals displayed in simple cards with protein/time info
- Dinner prioritized first, then backfill with lunch/breakfast

### **Future Vision:**
- **Click into meals** ‚Üí Show detailed recipe view
- **Recipe format:** Simplified New York Times style
- **Ingredients breakdown:**
  - Items from your cart (highlighted)
  - Assumed pantry items (salt, oil, etc.)
  - Missing ingredients with swap suggestions
  - Meat swaps or substitutions when available

### **Visual Design for Recipes:**
- **Pictures:** Will be challenging - need to solve later
- **Icons:** Want 2D sketches/pencil drawings (like Penny aesthetic)
- **Style:** Clean, minimal, data-focused
- Need repository of ingredient sketches (cucumbers, zucchini, etc.)

## üé® **Visual Design Notes**

### **Typography & Colors:**
- **Item names:** Penny blue (#4169E1) for better visibility ‚úÖ
- **Reference:** Old Penny menu layout with blue item names
- **Goal:** Make item names "pop" more than current state

### **Icons & Illustrations:**

- **Future:** Pencil sketch style illustrations for ingredients
- **Inspiration:** Cute but clean 2D sketches

## ‚ö° **Performance & Backend Strategy**

### **Current Challenge:**
- Need to test full flow: Analyze ‚Üí Scrape ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí Display
- Measure total time from click to results

### **Proposed Backend Optimization:**
1. **Initial Trigger:** Start cart scrape right after user completes onboarding
2. **Scheduled Updates:** 
   - Run everyone's cart analysis Thursday night/Friday morning
   - Send proactive SMS updates
   - Pre-generate meal suggestions for faster response

### **User Flow Optimization:**
- **Current:** User clicks "Analyze" ‚Üí Wait 20-30 seconds ‚Üí Results
- **Future:** Background processing ‚Üí Near-instant results

## üìä **Data Structure Improvements**

### **Real Cart Data Usage:**
- Successfully implemented last week's actual scraping data ‚úÖ
- Shows real producers: "Locust Point Farm", "Red's Best Seafood"
- Proper quantities and pricing

### **Missing Data Points:**
- User preference integration (dietary restrictions, goals)
- Historical meal completion rates
- Swap acceptance tracking
- Recipe rating system
