# Implementation Status - Sept 18, 2025

## CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX IMMEDIATELY:

### 1. Add-ons Currently Broken ❌
- Add-ons hardcoded to empty array `[]`
- Need to call `generate_meal_addons()` after meals generated
- Located in server.py analyze_cart_api function

### 2. Cancel Button Not Working ❌
- Only clears client timers, doesn't stop server scraping
- Need AbortController in dashboard.html
- Scraping continues even after "cancel"

### 3. Swaps Position Inconsistent ❌
- Different placement local vs production
- Need standardization

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN APPROVED:

**Phase 1**: Fix empty add-ons bug by calling meal-aware function
**Phase 2**: Add protein gap detection
**Phase 3**: Implement cancel functionality
**Phase 4**: Standardize UI

## FILES TO MODIFY:

1. `/server/server.py` - Lines ~1750+ where meals are generated
2. `/server/services/meal_generator.py` - Enhance generate_meal_addons
3. `/server/templates/dashboard.html` - Add AbortController

## KEY INSIGHT:
Add-ons should suggest items NOT available in swaps:
- Fresh herbs/aromatics for specific meals
- Missing proteins when cart has gaps
- Always return 2-3 suggestions, never empty

## NEXT: Continue implementation in new conversation
Context: Working on smart add-ons architecture with meal-aware suggestions
