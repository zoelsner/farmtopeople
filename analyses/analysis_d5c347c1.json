This dramatically expands recipe options (shakshuka, roasted chicken trays, pan sauces) and reduces fruit redundancy.\n\nPriority Swap #2: The Cook’s Box - Paleo - Swap Lunchbox Peppers → Organic Bunched Rainbow Carrots  \nReasoning: Carrots add a sturdy root veg for roasting, slaws, and mirepoix with onions—key for balanced meals and meal-prep longevity. They also pair well with fish and chicken and store longer than mini peppers.\n\nOptional Swap #3: The Cook’s Box - Paleo - Swap Unagi Cucumbers → Organic Scallions  \nReasoning: Scallions boost flavor for marinades, salads, and the sea bass prep without needing a full onion each time. If you love chopped salads, keep cucumbers; if you want more aromatic lift, choose scallions.\n\n### Recommended Protein Additions to Cart\nHealthy protein options (no beef):\n- Skin-on Wild Salmon Fillet ($16.99, 8 oz) fillets (great with tomato/avocado or peach salsa)\n- Wild shrimp (fast; perfect with zucchini “noodles” or roasted carrots)\n- Locust Point Farm Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs ($8.99, 0.6-1 lb) (juicier for sheet-pans; great leftovers)\n- White Ground Turkey ($8.99, 1.0 lb) (for lettuce wraps, patties, or meatballs)\n- Pork tenderloin (lean; roasts well with carrots/onions)\n- Canned wild tuna or sardines (pantry-friendly for chopped salads)\n- Optional if not strictly paleo: extra-firm tofu or tempeh\n\n### Strategic Meal Plan (5 balanced meals)\n\nMeal 1: Herb-Roasted Chicken & Ratatouille Tray (3-4 servings)  \nUsing: Chicken breast, organic green zucchini, organic Italian eggplant, mixed cherry tomatoes, Yellow Onions (Swap #1), avocado (as herb-avocado drizzle)  \nStatus: ✅ Complete with pantry staples + garlic + lemon/herbs\n\nMeal 2: Seared Black Sea Bass with Peach-Avocado Salsa + Roasted Carrots (2 servings)  \nUsing: Black sea bass, seasonal local yellow peaches (fruit medley), 1 avocado, mixed cherry tomatoes, Organic Bunched Rainbow Carrots (Swap #2), optional Unagi cucumbers OR Organic Scallions (Swap #3)  \nStatus: ✅ Just add lime/lemon + cilantro/chili for the salsa\n\nMeal 3: Sunrise Egg & Avocado Lettuce Wraps (3 servings)  \nUsing: Eggs, organic leaf lettuce, sautéed organic green zucchini + Yellow Onions (Swap #1), mixed cherry tomatoes, avocado  \nStatus: ✅ Needs only oil/salt/pepper; hot sauce optional\n\nMeal 4: Chopped Market Salad with Jammy Eggs & Organic Organic Lemons ($1.99) ($1.99)-Tahini (2 servings)  \nUsing: Organic leaf lettuce, Unagi cucumbers (or scallions if swapped), Organic Bunched Rainbow Carrots (Swap #2), mixed cherry tomatoes, avocado, eggs  \nStatus: ✅ Add lemon + tahini + olive oil for dressing\n\nMeal 5: Smoky Eggplant-Zucchini Shakshuka (3-4 servings)  \nUsing: Organic Italian eggplant, organic green zucchini, mixed cherry tomatoes, Yellow Onions (Swap #1), eggs, avocado (garnish)  \nStatus: ✅ Add garlic + spices (smoked paprika, cumin); optional 1 can crushed tomatoes to stretch\n\nNotes on fruit usage to prevent waste:\n- Snack/dessert: Prune plums and Honeycrisp apples fresh\n- Quick sides: Apple–carrot slaw with lemon for Meals 1 or 2\n- Bananas: Breakfast smoothies or freeze halves for “nice cream”\n\n### Additional Fresh Items Needed\n- Garlic ($2.99) (essential)\n- Citrus: lemons and limes\n- Fresh herbs: cilantro, parsley, basil\n- Optional aromatics: Fresh Ginger ($3.99)\n- Optional heat: jalapeño or Fresno chile (if you didn’t swap one in)\n- Optional greens: baby spinach or arugula (for added salad variety)\n\n### Pantry Staples Needed\n- Oils: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil (high-heat)\n- Vinegars: red wine and apple cider\n- Mustard (Dijon) and tahini\n- Sea salt, black pepper\n- Spices: smoked paprika, cumin, coriander, oregano, chili flakes\n- Honey or maple syrup (for dressings)\n- Coconut aminos or tamari (for sautés/marinades)\n- Capers (great with fish or chicken piccata-style)\n- Optional: 1 can crushed tomatoes (for shakshuka)\n\n### Summary\nWith recommended proteins: You’ll have approximately 18–21 complete servings with excellent variety and no food waste!  \nCurrent plan yields about 13 servings using your existing proteins and eggs.
