Red onions add essential aromatics for almost every savory dish (sheet-pan chicken, shakshuka, salsas, salads) and improve shelf life and versatility.\n\nPriority Swap #2: The Cook’s Box – Paleo - Swap Lunchbox Peppers → Red Fresno Peppers  \nReasoning: Fresnos bring real flavor and gentle heat for shakshuka, larb, and salsas while still roasting well. Lunchbox peppers are best for snacking and are less versatile in cooked recipes.\n\nOptional Swap #3: The Cook’s Box – Paleo - Swap Organic Leaf Lettuce → Organic Bunched Rainbow Carrots  \nReasoning: Carrots expand cookable sides (roasts, slaws) and store longer. Keep the lettuce if you plan lots of salads; choose carrots if you prefer more hot meals.\n\n### Recommended Protein Additions to Cart\nHealthy protein options (no beef):\n- Wild shrimp (quick-cook; great with zucchini or in lettuce cups)\n- Sockeye Wild Salmon Fillet ($16.99, 8 oz) or Arctic char (pairs with peach–plum salsa)\n- Locust Point Farm Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs ($8.99, 0.6-1 lb) (sheet-pan friendly, juicier than breasts)\n- White White Ground Turkey ($8.99, 1.0 lb) (for lettuce-wraps, patties, meatballs)\n- Pork kielbasa or clean-ingredient chicken sausage (sheet-pan with carrots/zucchini)\n- Canned wild tuna or salmon (for quick avocado “no-mayo” salads)\n- Smoked salmon (with eggs and avocado for breakfast/lunch)\n\n### Strategic Meal Plan (5 balanced meals)\n\nMeal 1: One-Pan Mediterranean Chicken and Late-Summer Veg (4 servings)  \nUsing: Chicken breast, zucchini, Italian eggplant, red onion (Swap #1), Fresno pepper (Swap #2), mixed cherry tomatoes; lemon, garlic, oregano, olive oil.  \nStatus: ✅ Complete with basic pantry (lemon/garlic/oregano/olive oil).
